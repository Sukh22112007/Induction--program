# Day 2
Our second day started with a lecture in the college auditorium on Universal Human Values (UHV). The speaker began by explaining what UHV means and why it is important in our personal and professional lives. They talked about values like honesty, respect, empathy, trust, and harmony, and how these can help us build better relationships with others. The session was not just theory â€” the speaker also gave real-life examples and stories to make the concepts easier to understand. We were encouraged to think about our own lives and reflect on how we can apply these values in our daily behaviour. The atmosphere was interactive, and many students shared their thoughts, which made the session even more engaging.

After lunch, we had our English class and proficiency test. The teacher explained that the purpose of the test was to check our skills in vocabulary, grammar, reading, and speaking. We first attempted the written part, which included comprehension passages, sentence correction, and short answers. Later, we had speaking exercises where we interacted in small groups to practice our communication skills. The class was helpful because the teacher gave us tips on how to improve our fluency and confidence while speaking in English. Overall, the day was a good mix of learning about life values and improving our language skills.
